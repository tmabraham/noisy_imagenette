# Noisy Imagenette Baseline (01-18-2021)

The baseline was trained with the following argumeents:

```
--lr 8e-3 --sqrmom 0.99 --mom 0.95 --eps 1e-6 --bs 64 --opt ranger --sa 1 --fp16 1 --arch xse_resnext50 --pool MaxPool
```

These params are changed as appropriate for each run:
```
--woof --pct_noise --size --epochs
```

It was trained with [this version](https://github.com/tmabraham/noisy_imagenette/blob/19f95596d13892a8f351532bf1cc28946fc56437/train_noisy_imagenette.py) of `train_noisy_imagenette.py`. Training jobs were run with [this version](https://github.com/tmabraham/noisy_imagenette/blob/19f95596d13892a8f351532bf1cc28946fc56437/baseline/run_leaderboard.sh) of the `run_leaderboard.sh` script. Training was done on 4 Titan RTX GPUs, each GPU running a different level of noise. All results are from a single run, with a seed set to 999 (`set_seed(999, reproducible=True)`).
